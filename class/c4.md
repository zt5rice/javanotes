# Queue and Stack
## Basics



- Difference between average v.s. amortize time?
    - amortized time: for any specific input, we amortized all operations within this input;
    - Average time:  
## Questions
### Entry
1. Sort the number in two stacks (analyze from no duplication)

2. MergeSort with three Stacks (hard)

3. Implement queue by two stacks: the average of all possible inputs in the input space (e.g. quicksort).


### Medium
1. How to use multiple stacks to implement deque?


### Hard
1. Use three stacks to improve the time complexity of remove() operation


## Discussion and Summary
1. Properties of stack move between two stacks:
    - First transition reverse order
    - Second transition restore original order
2. What kind of question need stack? - Linear scan and look back
    a. Repeated deduplication in String;
    b. Reverse polish notation - Shunting yard algorithm;
    c. Max rectangular in Histogram;
