## Recursion 1 and sorting

### Recursion 
- Recursion
    - function call itself
    - boil down a big problem to another one
    - implementation:
        - base rule 
        - recursion rule
        
- Complexity analysis
    - TC: addition of all nodes time consumption
    - SC: addition of all space consumption of one up-down path
            
 #### Recursion 
 - Fibonacci
 
 - Merge sort
 
 - Quick sort
 
 - Rainbow sort
