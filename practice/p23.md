# Concurrency II 

- What are conditions for a deadlock?
    - Mutual exclusion: at least one resources must be held in a non-sharable mode/ Only one process can use the resource at any given instant time.
    - Hold and wait or Resource holding (avoid nesting critical sections) - a process is holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.
    - No preemption: (timed wait) a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process hold it.
    - Circular wait: acquire the locks in order;
    
## Atomicity
- What is the atomicity?
    - When a thread modifies the state of some object( or set of objects), another thread can't see any intermediary state. 
    - Either see the state before or after the operation;
    - The volatile keyword - guarantee visibility, much like acquiring and releasing the lock;
