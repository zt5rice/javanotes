# Language comparison and GC

## Langugage comparison

- What are the difference between java and c++?
    1. Platform compatiability: JAVA - write once, run everywhere on JVM; C++: different codes on different matchine
    2. Better performance: compile to native language;
        a. java source code -> JVM readable byte code(.java -> .class) - compile
        b. JVM interprets the Java bytecode to pre-compiled routine on machine code - interpret.
    3. JIT (just in time) compilation to compile the bytecode to native instruction; - compile
    4. Object-Orient Program paradigm - everything in java is a class/object
    5. All types (primitives, reference types) are always passed by value;
    6. Java does not support unsigned numbers;
    7. Pointer v.s. reference: no pointer arithmetics.
        - reference in Java are strongly typed;
        - no pointer arithmetic on references;
    8. No operator overloading. "+""-"
    9. Class/Objects are always allocated on the heap, no way on stack
    10. Gabage collection. Don't have to consider memory management/ memory leak;
    11. Single inheritance generally. or implementing multiple interfaces;
    
- What is the java's compiler/interpreter/JVM/JRE/JDK?
    - compiler: javac
    - interpreter: jvm
    - vitural machine: JVM - JRE is the JVM program: JRE = JVM + library class;
    - JRE: java running environment; 
    - JDK: java development kit; contains tool for developing programs running on JRE

What is JVM?
    - the JVM is an abstract computing machine. The JVM is a program that looks like a machine to programs written to execute it.
