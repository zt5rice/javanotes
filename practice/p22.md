# Concurrency ()

## Concurrency v.s. Parallel
- What is concurrency and parallel ?
    - concurrency: multiple task run simultaneously
    - parallel: multiple task physically run simultaneously


    
    
## Process v.s. Thread
- What is process?
    - An independent execution of instrument with independent memory space, stack, heap and resources.
    - Each process sees a complete memory space
    - Different processes communicate through interprocess communication;
- 什么是进程，线程？什么关系？
    - 在计算机中，我们把一个任务称为一个进程
    - 某些进程内部还需要同时执行多个子任务。我们把子任务称为线程。
    - 进程和线程的关系就是：一个进程可以包含一个或多个线程，但至少会有一个线程。
    - 操作系统调度的最小任务单位其实不是进程，而是线程。
- What is Thread?
    - An independent execution of instrument with shared memory space, stack, heap and resources.
    - Each thread has its private: stack, program counter and register state/
    - Thread in the same process has shared: heap, static memory segment, os resources;
    - Communication performed through shared memory read/writes
    - Lightweight data and resource sharing (compare to process)
    
- What is the fundamental differences between process and thread?
    - if they have independent memory space;
    
- What is Java thread and how can we creat java thread?
    - Create the threads objects;
    - Tell the threads what you want them to do;
    - Start the thread;
````
Thread t = new Thread(); = native method call, created one system Thread;
t.start(); - schedule the created thread and make ready to go
t.join(); - make sure the threads end after this line

````

- What are ways of creating thread and make them running?
    - extends the tread
    - implements runnable

- What is a thread's life cycle?
    - start()
    - Object.wait()
    - yield;
    
## Synchronization and race
- What is data race? 3 factors of data race?
    - more than 1 operation work on the same memory location
    - at least one operation is a write;
    - at least two of those operations are concurrent;

- How to prevent data race?
  - In java, simplest way is to define the method or class with the synchronized keyword;


## Mutuaal exclusion, critical section, and lock
- What is critical section?
    A part of a multi-process program that may not be concurrently executed by more than one of the programs' processes/ thread;

- How to create critical sessions?
    - By locks;
    - two general lock operations: lock and unlock;
    - lock: wait no one is there and go into the critical session;
    - unlock: leave the critical section and mark no one is there;

# Practice: write a thread safe hashmap

## Condition synchronization

## Atomicity
