# Integers and Strings

## Bit operation for integers

- What is the difference between >> and >>>?
    - '>>' is arithmetic shift right, '>>>' is logical shift right.
    - '>>' fills the 1 or 0 dependent on sign, while '>>>' always fills 0.
    
- Autoboxing and unboxing
    - Autoboxing: automatically change primitive type to object;
    - Unboxing: reverse of autoboxing
    - +-*/<> <= >= only applies to primitive types;
    - ||, == means differently between two types;
    - no autoboxing exists between int[] v.s. Integer[];

- Primitive type v.s. wrapper class
    - wrapper class are immutable, can't change after initialization
    - always prefer primitives, because of overhead;   
     
- Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer
    - exactly the same thing
    - StringBuffer is thread safe, each method is synchronized, and slower
    - StringBuilder is not thread safe, it intends to be used in single thread environment.
