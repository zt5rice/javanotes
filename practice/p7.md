# Binary Tree and graph

- Binary Tree implementation

````
class TreeNode {
    int key;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    public TreeNode(int key) {
        this.key = key;
    }
}
````

- General Tree, each node has arbitary number of children
````
class TreeNode {
    int key;
    List<TreeNode> children; 
    public TreeNode(int key) {
        this.key = key;
        children = new ArrayList<TreeNode>();
    }
}
````

- Graph implementation
````
class GraphNode {
    int key;
    List<GraphNode> children; 
    public TreeNode(int key) {
        this.key = key;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<GraphNode>();
    }
}
````

- Traversals of Binary Tree recursively/iteratively         
    - preorder: root[left][right]
    - inorder:  [left]root[right]
    - postorder:    [left][right]root    
    - levelorder:

- Basic operations of BST        
       
| Operation  |   worst   |   Balanced    |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|   search()    |   o(n)    |   o(logn)    |
|   insert()    |   o(n)    |   o(logn)    |
|   remove()    |   o(n)    |   o(logn)    |

- Tail recursion and its properties

    - recursion call @ last execution statement
    - easy transfer to iterative solution

- Practice: insert in BST by recursion/iteration

- Practice: Delete in BST by recursion/iteration

- Practice: Binary tree transversal inorder/preorder/postorder/level order in recursion/iteration
